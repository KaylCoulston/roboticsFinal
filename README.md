Robotics Final Project
==========

Project Discription 
----

Our final robotics project will be split into three parts. These three parts consist of a robotic arm, navigation using SLAM, and vision processing. Our task for this final project will be to go to the FIZ, pick up a bin of tools and bring back that bin to Dana 3. We will be using SLAM to navigate to the FIZ, in the FIZ and back to Dana 3. Our robotic arm will be attached to the turtlebot. This arm will be capable of picking up a custom bin and holding until we reach our drop off location. Vision processing will be used to determine the correct bin that needs to be picked up.

 
The levels of deliverables are as follows:
 
  Level 1:
    Using SLAM to map IRLL and fiz
    Using SLAM to navigate to and from fiz
    Human puts tool in bin on top of rover
    Obstacle avoidance/dynamic path planning
 
  Level 2:
    Incorporate arm
    Vision processing for finding a bin
    Vision processing for picking up bin
 
  Level 3:
    Turtle bot knows how to self charge
    Face Recognition (human robot interaction with only certain humans aka fiz workers)
    Vision processing for locating specific bin
